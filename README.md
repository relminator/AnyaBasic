# AnyaBasic
[A]bsolutely [N]ot [Y]our [A]verage BASIC

"The little toy language that could."

![Alt text](http://www.rel.phatcode.net/Mypics/abscreenshot01.png "SHMUP")

AnyaBASIC is a portable Interpreted Programming Language made in Java. 
It has a syntax similar to BASIC with a bit of C, Javascript and PASCAL thrown in.

This is a "Toy Language", so don't expect much. However, while this started as a "joke",
this language evolved into something which is capable of doing a
lot more(games, graphics, etc). It's also a language whose keywords are in English 
so it should be a good language to use in teaching kids how to program.

Release 0.5.1

Installing:

* Unzip the archive to any directory of your choice.
* C:/Programming/ is recommended for the ConTEXT IDE to work.
* There's a video of how to set up an offline version
  of Context on my facebook page(read the docs for the link).

How to run the sample codes:

Usage: java -cp AnyaBasic.jar net.phatcode.rel.main.AnyaBasicMain <source.abs> 

* Just type the above line on the terminal/console or
* Double click any of the "runxxxxxx.bat" for Windows users.  
* For graphics and sound apps, you need to include the lib path:
> Java -Djava.library.path=. -cp AnyaBasic.jar net.phatcode.rel.main.AnyaBasicMain <source.abs>
* See the batch and SH files in the samples section.
* You can also use the accompanying ConTEXT editor as an IDE to make coding a bit easier.


Fun fact:

* The language supports "jejemon" and "tagalog" keywords. 
* Please read the docs for the keyword counterparts or open and run
  "jejetaggame.abs"

How to Compile:

You need to add the jar files in the /libs folder as modules and
add references to their native bindings. The native binaries are those 
DLL, SO and LIB files found in the directory where AnyaBasic.jar is located.
