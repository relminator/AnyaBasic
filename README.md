"The little toy language that could."

AnyaBASIC is a portable Interpreted Programming Language made in Java. 
It has a syntax similar to BASIC with a bit of C, Javascript and PASCAL thrown in.

This is a "Toy Language", so don't expect much. However, while this started as a "joke",
this language evolved into something which is capable of doing a
lot more(games, graphics, etc). It's also a language whose keywords are in English 
so it should be a good language to use in teaching kids how to program.

* For graphics and sound apps, you need to include the lib path:
```bash
$java -Djava.library.path=. -jar AnyaBasic.jar <source.abs>
```
* See the batch and SH files in the [samples](samples) section.
* You can also use the accompanying [ConTEXT editor](http://www.contexteditor.org/index.php) as an IDE to make coding a bit easier.
